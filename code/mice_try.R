##| method = "rf". Random forest models allow us to use both numerical and factorial variables in the imputation. Therefore, code, sampling and plot are used
##| m = 10 is the number of datasets that mice creates. This is, 10 values of nind_m2
##| maxit is the number of times that mice iterates through each dataset. The higher, the more stable (in complex database)
